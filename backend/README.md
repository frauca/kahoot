# Server project

this server project is made with Spring boot. With the WebFlux. 

The global idea is to run without any further resource or configuration

## Store

I plan to use h2 relational database. It will store the information on a local file, relative to the jar of the server.

## Pending

* Change to a non-blocking embeded database
* Clear all games at start
