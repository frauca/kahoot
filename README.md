# Project   

I want to lear spring 5 reactive programing and vuex. I will make a little project with both technologies to make kahoot projects.

The features will be:

* It will be anonymous without identification
* It could be possible to generate a questionary
* It will be possible to add questions to a questionary
* Each question could have a maximum of 4 answers
* At least one answer could be possible
* It could be run a questionary whenever
* On run the questionary it will wait until one user is i, it have a name and press start
* Once started each question has 25 seconds counter down.
* If every one has answered then it goes to the next question.
* At the end shows the results just correct answeres and order by that
